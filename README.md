# MATLAB_NB
This repository holds a project submitted for the Machine Learning course at City, University of London. 
The aim of the project was to compare the performances of two algorithms: Decision Trees and Naive Bayes for a text classification problem.
The code is in MATLAB.
For this coursework I teamed with my fellow classmate Federico Cardoni.
